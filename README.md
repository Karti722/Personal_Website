# Personal_Website
A superior version of my portfolio website that was previously hosted through GitHub pages. This one will be hosted through Vercel. 

# Tech Stack
Using Typescript + Next.js + Vercel.

# Goal
To convert this website already deployed as this github pages link into a vercel app instead. This reworked website will replace the GitHub pages portfolio link as I want this to be a dynamic Next.js app, instead of a static HTML,CSS website. I have created a link to redirect to my GitHub pages portfolio as a time capsule. 

# Current URL link:
https://kartikeyakumaria.vercel.app/

# Old Github Pages Portfolio Link replaced:
https://karti722.github.io/Portfolio/
