# Personal_Website
A superior version of my portfolio website that was previously hosted through GitHub pages. This one will be hosted through Vercel and will have a Google forms for improvement. Using Typescript + Next.js + Vercel. 

# Goal
To convert this website already deployed as this github pages link into a vercel app instead. This reworked website will replace the GitHub pages portfolio link as I want this to be a dynamic Next.js app, instead of a static HTML,CSS website. I will create a link to redirect to my GitHub pages portfolio as a time capsule. 

# Old Github Pages Portfolio Link I want to replace:
https://karti722.github.io/Portfolio/

# New URL Link to replace the old link with:
https://kartikeyakumaria.vercel.app/
